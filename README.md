# ServiceHub
> This is a project I developed in a short period of time for Agile development module in University.
> Also this was my 1st Android App ever.

ServiceHub is the platform that connects consumers and service providers in a different way. In
this, users can search the services based on location, budget, and Local vendors and service providers can list out their skills, charges, and the location they want to provide their service. Users can easily find the services in nearby areas. It’s the best way that a small business or an individual can reach with the seekers through application and connect with the audience by showing their skills online.

ServiceHub allows users to connect with skilled and experienced professionals for at-home service. One of many use scenario is:

There's Anna who wants to get a haircut, but she has got leg injury. All she has to do is just go on the application and search for hair stylist, like Joe who's got skills but doesn't have a shop to earn money and show off his skills. All he did was just signed up on the application and set his preferences like how much he wants to charge, what services he can provide, and much more!

Moreover, the platform uses its advanced match-making algorithm to search for the nearest professional who matches the user’s requirements and is available at the given date and time.
